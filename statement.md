###### **PROJECT STATEMENT: Blood Pressure Tracker**

###### 

###### **PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

###### 

###### The modern healthcare paradigm emphasizes proactive, long-term monitoring of vital signs. It is cumbersome, error-prone, and disorganized for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension to record in analog logs their blood pressure readings. This is a problem because there is a lack of available, reliable, and analytic digital mechanisms that can provide tracking of personal health data continuously for timely self-management and physician consultation. 

###### 

###### **AIM OF THE PROJECT:**

###### 

###### The scope of the Blood Pressure Tracker is to develop a single-user application, which handles the complete life cycle of blood pressure data right from secure ingestion to meaningful visualization and management. Inclusions

###### Recording systolic, diastolic, and pulse readings.

###### CRUD Persistent data storage and retrieval.

###### Categorization of readings was performed automatically according to current clinical standards.

###### Time-series data visualization-graphical representation of trends.

###### Basic data quality control via input validation and error handling.

###### 

###### **Exclusions:**

###### 

* ###### Integration with external hardware, such as automated blood pressure cuffs.
* ###### Direct communication with EHR systems.
* ###### Providing complex medical diagnosis or prescriptive clinical advice.
* ###### Multi-user accounts, or cloud synchronization beyond the data storage mechanism of the repository.

###### 

###### **TARGET USERS:**

###### 

###### The application is intended for users needing routine and long-term blood pressure monitoring. People suffering from Hypertension

###### The primary audience requiring the tracking of a drug's efficacy or certain changes in lifestyle.

###### 

* ###### Seniors and Caregivers:

###### Users who need a straightforward and efficient interface for logging and reviewing health data.

###### 

* ###### Fitness and Health Devotees:

###### Proactive individuals who track physiological data as part of a wider wellness routine.

###### HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES The project involves three main functional modules that the project specifications asked for: Data Input

###### Provides a dedicated screen for quick, validated entry of new blood pressure readings.

###### 

###### **Functionality**: Create

###### Data History and Analysis

###### 

###### Provides a sortable log of all historical readings, complete with automatic categorization and calculation of summary averages.

###### Functionality:

###### &nbsp;Read / Processing

###### 

###### **Trend Visualization:**

###### 

###### Creates graphical charts to illustrate the fluctuation in blood pressure over time, such as 30/90 days.

###### Functionality: Reporting Data Management Allow the user to correct mistakes, or permanently delete certain entries from the history log. Functionality: 

###### Update / Delete
